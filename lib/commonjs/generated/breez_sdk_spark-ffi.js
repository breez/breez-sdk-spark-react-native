// We could:
// (a) do some complicated template logic to ensure the declaration is not generated here (possible)
// (b) import the generated declaration into the runtime (m a y b e) orâ€¦
// (c) generate the declaration anyway, and use a different declaration in the runtime.
//
// We chose (c) here as the simplest. In addition, we perform a compile time check that
// the two versions of `UniffiRustFutureContinuationCallback` are structurally equivalent.
//
// If you see the error:
// ```
// Type 'true' is not assignable to type 'false'.(2322)
// ```
// Then a new version of uniffi has changed the signature of the callback. Most likely, code in
// `typescript/src/async-rust-call.ts` will need to be changed.
//
// If you see the error:
// ```
// Cannot find name 'UniffiRustFutureContinuationCallback'. Did you mean 'RuntimeUniffiRustFutureContinuationCallback'?(2552)
// ```
// then you may not be using callbacks or promises, and uniffi is now not generating Futures and callbacks.
// You should not generate this if that is the case.
